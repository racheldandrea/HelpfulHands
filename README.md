# HelpfulHands

As a future secondary educator and childcare worker, I know firsthand how overwhelming it can be to manage daily classroom tasks using multiple apps and platforms. I created Helpful Hands, a user-friendly app that simplifies life for teachers and school staff.

Helpful Hands features a clean, intuitive bottom navigation bar, giving you quick access to everything you need: Student Dashboard: View and manage student profiles, birthdays, and parent contact info — all in one place.

Teacher To-Do Schedule: A flexible Monday–Friday calendar where you can schedule meetings, conferences, grading time, or create your own custom tasks.

Timer Tool: Set, pause, and restart countdowns with ease — and enjoy a little celebration with a fun confetti animation when time’s up!

Activity Prompt Generator: Need a quick idea? Browse by grade level or theme (like “Rainy Day”) for engaging K–12 activities to keep students learning and having fun.

Helpful Hands is about saving time, reducing stress, and bringing a little joy back into your day because teachers deserve tools that work as hard as they do!
